=======LCM Calculator========

To modify the given Java program, the approach involved integrating file handling mechanisms to 
read input values from a text file, utilizing the existing LCM calculation method, and displaying 
the result in the console. By incorporating file reading functionality and leveraging the existing 
LCM calculation method, the program efficiently computed the LCM from external input and displayed 
it directly to the console, enhancing its functionality and usability.

	Purpose:
		This little Java tool helps you find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two big numbers. 
		It's perfect for when you're dealing with numbers that are too large for regular integer types.

	How it Works:
		The program reads two numbers from a text file named input.txt, 
		calculates their LCM using the BigInteger class, and displays the result on the console.

	What You Need:
		Just make sure you have Java installed on your computer. 
		Then, follow the instructions below to compile and run the program.
		
	How to Use:

Download the ZIP File: 
	Download the ZIP file containing the Java program (LCMCalculator.java) 
	and the input file template (input.txt).

Extract the ZIP File: 
	Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired directory on your computer. 
	You should have the following files in the extracted folder; (note, you dont have to extract to a new folder)
	+ Ladringan_Jerdelyne_MidtermReq.java
	+ input.txt

Update Input Data:(Optional)
	Open the input.txt file using a text editor.
	Replace the placeholder numbers with the numbers you want to find the LCM of. 
	Ensure each number is on a separate line. If you want,, this is optional.|

Open the program: 
	Open the .java file using any program that you have. Or double click on the .java file
	as it opens immediately.


Run the program:
	Save the java file updates. Then click on run.

Output:
	The program should automatically read the data inside the input.txt file that we have 
	provided, the LCM of the two numbers should appear in the output terminal.
